# WhatsApp Message Automation
### The hard way to use WhatsApp Broadcast feature
---
### Getting Started
  * __Python3__ should be installed on your computer.
  
  * __Selenium__ should be installed on your computer too.
    You can install by opening your Terminal/Command prompt and and then typing "pip3 install selenium" 
    and then hitting enter.

  * __ChromeDriver__ must be installed on your computer. You can go [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), 
and download the ChromeDriver executable file.


### Using it 
  * Give the path to your chromedriver.exe file in your system, in place of .Chrome('***here***').

  * You have to enter the names of the contacts and the groups in the ***all_names*** list.

  * Also give the path to the attachment you want to send. If any. Or comment out that part.
  
  * And feel free to change the timings in sleep(***secs***). I have made it suitable for
  my internet connection speed.

###### Now, you can enjoy the complex way of using WhatsApp Broadcast feature.
