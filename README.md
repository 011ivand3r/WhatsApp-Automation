# WhatsApp Message Automation
#### The hard way to use WhatsApp Broadcast feature

### Getting Started
    1. **Python3** should be installed on your computer.

    2. **Selenium** should be installed on your computer too.
    You can install by opening your Terminal/Command prompt and and then typing "pip3 install selenium" 
    and then hitting enter.

    3. **ChromeDriver** must be installed on your computer. You can go [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), 
    and download the chromedriver executable file.
    
### Using it 
    1. Give the path to your chromedriver.exe file in your system, in place of .Chrome('*here*').

    2. You have to enter the names of the contacts and the groups in the *all_names* list.

    3. Also give the path to the attachment you want to send. If any. Or comment out that part.

Now, you can enjoy the complex way of using WhatsApp Broadcast feature.
